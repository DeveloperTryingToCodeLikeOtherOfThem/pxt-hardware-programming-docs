## How to understand and determine what the lesson is explaining in the Makeode Arcade docs.

To understand what the lesson is explaining about is to **read** what it is explaining about,
and then code your own engine. Also, when you see in the docs shows something like function sprites.create,
that is invalid, that is just a quick work around showing the namespace that exported sprites.create.

But if you really create a function called sprites.create, it will not work because it has invalid characters 
and not exports in the namespace.
