## The history of bytes 

The practice of using bytes as a fundamental unit of digital information dates back to the early days of computing. A byte, typically consisting of 8 bits, became a standard largely due to its convenience. An 8-bit byte can represent 256 different values, which is sufficient for encoding characters in standards like ASCII, representing colors, and handling various other forms of data efficiently. The widespread adoption of the 8-bit byte was heavily influenced by popular computer architectures, such as the IBM System/360.
