## The history of bytes 

The history that almost everything in digital computers are stored in bytes comes down to the beginning of computers. 
The main reason why this happened is because of ASCII (the internals that computers be able to read for all the text and characters), colors, and 
everything else mostly can be grouped into 8 bits. This is why this unit was invented.
