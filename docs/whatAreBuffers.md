# Buffers in MakeCode Arcade
 
 In Microsoft MakeCode Arcade, the Buffer namespace is a core namespace designed for storing data precisely.  

 A **Buffer** is a **fixed size array of bytes (8 bits)**. It is also stored in **contiguous memory**. The difference between arrays and buffers come down to a fact of **precision**. Use **Buffers** for a fixed size array of bytes, but use **Arrays** for dynamic data types (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.) Arrays are **dynamic** (of a process or system)
 
 In **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**, arrays automatically dynamic by default. Some languages do autotmatically have fixed size arrays by default, and while others  don't support it because they don't support resizing. A buffer is never dynamic, it always makes sure all the bytes are **fixed**. 

 A **bit** is a binary digit which uses base 2. For example, 8 bits stand for 8 binary digits. In base 2, we have only zeroes and ones because we have only 2 digits.

 The reason why buffers read by bytes instead of simple values because the computer understands bits (0, 1), which represents on and off in the computer architecture. 
* 0 = off
* 1 = on

Here is an example how they are connected to each other.

[Battery +] -----( SWITCH )-----[Light]-----[Battery -]

Binary math came to use electricity because engineers realized electrical switches naturally implement Boolean logic.

The person who created the boolean system is [Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz)
The person who created boolean alegebra is [Georg Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)
 
## Methods
    
 

* The Buffer.create(size: number) method is designed to store bytes in a fixed size.   

* The Buffer.setNumber(format: NumberFormat, offset: number, value: number) method is designed to write a number in a specified format in the buffer 

* The Buffer.getNumber(format: NumberFormat, offset: number) method is designed to read a number in a specified format in the buffer 

* The Buffer.setUint8(offset: number, value: number) method is designed to write an unsigned number in a particular location in the buffer 

* The Buffer.getUint8(offset: number) method is designed to read an unsigned number in a particular location in the buffer 

* The Buffer.write(dstOffset: number, src: Buffer) method is designed to write contents of the buffer merged into the current buffer (the buffer your using) 

* The Buffer.isReadOnly() method is designed to read if the buffer cannot be modified, otherwise it returns false
