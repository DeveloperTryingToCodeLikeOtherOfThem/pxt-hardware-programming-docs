## Downloading files in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade

To download files in MakeCode Arcade, it is simple, just click the download button in the bottom-center corner which is between the project's title bar and Github's logo.
All files are downloaded in the whole project itself, **not** by **indepent files**. The file's data type is a .mdck file.
