## How Many Bytes Does a File Need?
To determine how much memory a file requires, you need to consider its contents. For example, in a text file, the size is determined by the number of characters (including spaces and punctuation). Each character typically requires one or more bytes of storage.
For other types of files, like images, the calculation is different. For an image on a 160x120 pixel screen, the total memory needed would be the total number of pixels (160 * 120) multiplied by the number of bytes required to store the color of each pixel (which depends on the bits per pixel, or BPP).
