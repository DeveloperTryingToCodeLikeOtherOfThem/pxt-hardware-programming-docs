## Binary in MakeCode Arcade

In Microsoft MakeCode Arcade, binary stands for base 2, which has only 2 digits, zeroes and ones. While this represents is there are defintely less digits compared to decimal (base 10), computers like base 2 more because it is more convenient.
It is also because it directly relates to the on/off states in the hardware of the computer, this is the main reason why computers read and write mostly with binary.

An example here is showing.

* 0 = off
* 1 = on
