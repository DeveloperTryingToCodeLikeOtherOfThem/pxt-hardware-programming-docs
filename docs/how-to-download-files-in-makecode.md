## Downloading files in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade

To download files in MakeCode Arcade, it is simple, just click the download button in the bottom-center corner which is between the project's title bar and Github's logo.
All files are downloaded in the whole project itself, **not** by **indepent files**. The file's data type is a .mkcd (makecode) file. 
When the file is done downloading, the compiler will show a picture frame of the game in that moment.
This is mainly because it helps to easier identify that current frame that is happening to the game to make other users
to understand what is cool in this project. This is more like an ad showing something intresting about what the game is about
in that current frame.
