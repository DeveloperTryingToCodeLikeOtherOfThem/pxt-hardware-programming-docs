## Using Third Party in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade

Third Party stands for users that are unreleated to that organization or repository.
They just help editing the repository or organization to make it better.

MakeCode does **not** allow this anyway. This is mainly because they do not want
people accidentally not knowing what they're doing only **if** the code implementation
structure of the engine or game engine in the code is satisfied for the users that have permission (not 3rd party, 2nd or 1st party).
If you really edited and contribute the fork or any changes you made of the repository, there must have at least 1 maintainer 
approving if it is appropriate in case it would destroy the core of the engine and ruined parts of the engine.
