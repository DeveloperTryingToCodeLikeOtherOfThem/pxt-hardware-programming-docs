## Analyzing code

To analyze code (reading an entire engine wrapper full of management of sprites, physics, controlling, etc.),
you first must understand how the computer processes the data to the program, and how it runs internally before
coding the script in your own.

Previously, what I meant was that you have to mainly understand each line of code, and and how it operates in the 
computer or the device's operating system.
