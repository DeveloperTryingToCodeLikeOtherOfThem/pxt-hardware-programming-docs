## Analyzing code

To analyze code (reading an entire engine wrapper full of management of sprites, physics, controlling, etc.),
you first must understand how the computer processes that data to the program and how it runs internally before
coding that script in your own.

Previously, what I mean was you have to mainly understand each line of code what it does and how it operates in the 
computer or the device's operating system. This is the main goal what you need to start building massive engines.
