## Using Third Party in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade

Third Party means for users that are outside of the repository or organization that have no permission to edit the repository or orginization.

Which this means is that Third Party are for users that are unrelated to that organization or repository.
They just help editing the repository or organization to make it better.

MakeCode does **not** allow this anyway. This is mainly because they do not want
people accidentally not knowing what they're doing. It only be's fine **if** the code implementation
structure of the engine or game engine are accurate **not** incorrect. Then the code needs to be satisfied for the users that have permission (not 3rd party, 2nd or 1st party) for editing the repository or making changes of the files.

If you really edited and contribute the fork or any changes you made of the repository, there must have at least 1 maintainer 
approving if it is appropriate in case it would destroy the core of the engine and ruined parts of the engine.
