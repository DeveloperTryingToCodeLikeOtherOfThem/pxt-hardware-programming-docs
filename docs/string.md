## Strings in MakeCode Arcade

A string is a data type that is text. The computer reads the string by reading each character of the string.

The **length** property is a number returns all the characters of the string.

The **split** method splits text into smaller chunks by using a comma to divide the original sized string.

The **includes** method is a boolean that returns true if a string contained characters of an orginal string.
