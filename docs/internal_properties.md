## Internal Properties
Internal properties are components created by the MakeCode engine's runtime. An internal property is private and not available in the public APIs.
You can sometimes access private properties by inspecting the source files to see what properties exist. Properties that are intended to be strictly private are marked with the `private` modifier. Others might use the `protected` modifier.
You can access `protected` properties by defining a new class that `extends` the class containing them. Then, you can use the `this` keyword to access the property. This approach also works for accessing protected methods.
You might also encounter public properties that are not visible in the editor's block menu. This is often because their names are prefixed with an underscore (`_`), which hides them from the UI. The best way to find and use such a property is to locate its implementation in the source files and then use its name directly in your script. Alternatively, you can paste the property name into your code if you are sure about the spelling.
