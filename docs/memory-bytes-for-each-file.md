## How many bytes is enough for creating the file unit precisely

To know how many memory is enough for that file, you need  to think how many charcaters or punctuation is inserted in the document like word
that needs to be stored in the file you were writing. For instance, think of it like how many charcaters are there in the, 3 characters right because
they are t, h, and e that forms the whole word "the". The same thing for computers, they read by how many digits or charcaters that form the whole word
in the end. Use regular bytes for very simple projects like for example, the file has only a 160 * 120 screen in total are and store all the bits per pixel
filling the screen by doing this because it is simple, it is just storing individual bits into the screen.
